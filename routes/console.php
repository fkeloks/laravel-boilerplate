| This file is where you may define all of your Closure based console
| commands. Each Closure is bound to a command instance allowing a
| simple approach to interacting with each command's IO methods.
|
| Example:
|
| Artisan::command('inspire', function () {
|     $this->comment(\Illuminate\Foundation\Inspiring::quote());
| })->describe('Display an inspiring quote');
