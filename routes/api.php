| API Routes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here is where you can register API routes for your application. These
| routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider within a group which
| is assigned the "api" middleware group. Enjoy building your API!
|
| Example:
|
| Route::middleware('auth:api')->get('/user', function (\Illuminate\Http\Request $request) {
|     return $request->user();
| });
